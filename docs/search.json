    "text": "Useful tips for building an academic Quarto site\n\nUsing “Includes” for reusable content\nTo streamline updates across your site, use Quarto’s includes feature for reusable elements like syllabus statements, social sharing options, academic badges, and other reuseable materials. By doing this, you only need to update a single source file, and then rerender the site to reflect changes across all pages.\n{{include _statement.qmd}}\nPrefixing include file names with an underscore (“_“) ensures they won’t be rendered directly by Quarto.\nHere is an example course description, and reuse it in mainpage and syllabus.\n\n\nAcademic badges\nDisplay academic badges like the Dimension Citation badge and Altmetric badge.\n\nHere’s an example for embedding them:\n&lt;span class=\"__dimensions_badge_embed__\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-style=\"large_rectangle\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"1\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-hide-no-mentions=\"true\" class=\"altmetric-embed\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nReplace the doi with your own.\nMake sure to include below scripts in the same page to enable the badges:\n&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nYou can also showcase your highly cited and hot papers using custom badges.\n \n![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/highly-cited-paper-badge.png \"ESI Highly Cited Paper\"){width=20 fig-alt=\"Highly cited paper\"} ![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/hot-paper-badge.png \"ESI Hot Paper\"){width=20 fig-alt=\"Hot paper\"}\nHere is an example, and the source code.\n\n\nSocial sharing\nFor easy setup of social sharing buttons, AddToAny is a simple solution.\nUsing includes files here will make it easier to manage updates, as any changes to social buttons need only be made once.\nHere is an example.\n\n\nThe art of listing\nListings are a powerful tool in Quarto, offering flexibility for creating visually appealing and organized pages. By adjusting listing options, you can control how content is presented.\nType: default, grid, table\nOptions: grid-columns, image-height, grid-item-align\nDisplay: fields and field-display-names\nBy mastering these options, you can easily create pages that fit your content needs while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design.\nHere is an example, and source code; another example, and source code.\n\n\nListing external items\nIf you need to list external resources with key metadata, you can use this format to create clear, linked listings.\n    - path: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6\n      image: /files/images/journal/nature.avif\n      title: \"Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains\"\n      subtitle: \"*Nature*\"\n      description: \"Globalized supply chain has saved solar installers in the U.S., Germany, and China $67B 2008-2020, and solar prices will be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to produce domestically.\"\n      date: \"2022-10-26\"\nIf you have many items to list, it’s efficient to store them in a YAML(.yml) file. You can then reference this YAML file in Quarto.\nHere is an example, and source code."
