abstract={In this paper we analyse the non-wandering set of one-dimensional Greenberg–Hastings cellular automaton models for excitable media with  excited and  refractory states and determine its (strictly positive) topological entropy. We show that it results from a Devaney chaotic closed invariant subset of the non-wandering set that consists of colliding and annihilating travelling waves, which is conjugate to a skew-product dynamical system of coupled shift dynamics. Moreover, we determine the remaining part of the non-wandering set explicitly as a Markov system with strictly less topological entropy that also scales differently for large  .}

 abstract={Motivated by studies of the Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata (GHCA) as a caricature of excitable systems, in this paper we study kink-antikink dynamics in the perhaps simplest PDE model of excitable media given by the scalar reaction diffusion-type 
-equations for excitable angular phase dynamics. On the one hand, we qualitatively study geometric kink positions using the comparison principle and the theory of terraces. This yields the minimal initial distance as a global lower bound, a well-defined sequence of collision data for kinks- and antikinks, and implies that periodic pure kink sequences are asymptotically equidistant. On the other hand, we study metastable dynamics of finitely many kinks using weak interaction theory for certain analytic kink positions, which admits a rigorous reduction to ODE. By blow-up type singular rescaling we show that distances become ordered in finite time, and eventually diverge. We conclude that diffusion implies a loss of information on kink distances so that the entropic complexity based on positions and collisions in the GHCA does not simply carry over to the PDE model.}

  abstract          = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
