My research deals with different topics of pure and applied mathematics, touching the broad fields of analysis, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. Moreover, I enjoy teaching and have taught some Math courses for undergraduates.

<strong>News.</strong> Currently, I am looking for a full-time position in mathematical research or teaching (pure or applied) at a university.

I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/" target="_blank">Institute for Analysis and Numerics</a> of the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Münster</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/en/Pirner/index.shtml" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Marlies Pirner</a> and obtained my PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Bremen</a> under the supervison of <a href="https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/bereiche/am/ang-dynamische-systeme/personen/rademacher-jens.html" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Jens Rademacher</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de/dynsys/members/prof-dr-marc-kesseboehmer" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Marc Keßeböhmer</a>. Most recently, I worked as a lecturer and research assistant at <a href="https://www.hs-bremen.de/en/" target="_blank">HS Bremen</a>.

For some further details and additional information, see my <a href="/files/CV_UlbrichDennis.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
